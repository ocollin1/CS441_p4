Tower Defense
Tower Defense is an attempt at building a tower defense game in xcode while attempting to reuse code build in 
project 3 for collision detection and recognizing turret construction. The idea was to create new turrets
on touch and have each turret fire on the closest visable truck. However, I ran into an issue early on that I
haven't been able to solve. The main storyboard's behavior doesn't match the coded behavior, so I could not 
test major aspects of my code.
